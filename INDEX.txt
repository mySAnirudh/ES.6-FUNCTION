     Functions are the building blocks of readable, maintainable, and reusable code. Functions 
are defined using the function keyword. Following is the syntax for defining a standard 
function.
function function_name()
{
// function body
}
To force execution of the function, it must be called. This is called as function invocation. 
Following is the syntax to invoke a function.
function_name()
Example: Simple function definition
//define a function
function test()
{
 console.log("function called")
}
//call the function
test()
The example defines a function test(). A pair of delimiters ( { } ) define the function body. 
It is also called as the function scope. A function must be invoked to force its execution. 
The following output is displayed on successful execution of the above code.
